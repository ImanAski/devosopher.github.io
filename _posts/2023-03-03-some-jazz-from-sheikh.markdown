From Now on You can continue or start your journey in good old fashion jazz music in [n0omad](https://n0omad.github.io/)'s [telegram channel](https://t.me/sunnysidemag). I am eager to convince him to make the jazz mag project an open source project, So more jazz enthusiasts can contribute to the jazz mag project. The whole channel is going to be a cover up on the history of jazz. Don't forget to sbsribe and enjoy :)
